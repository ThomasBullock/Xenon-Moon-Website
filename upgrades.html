                    <p>
                        The ablative pulse plasma thruster modification provides a positive
                        increase to the Gamma Quad's acceleration and speed. This comes with a
                        small cost to manoeuvrability, but still an ideal upgrade for any Gamma
                        Quad.

                    <p>
                        Multistage thrusters offer a substantial increase in speed. Ideal for any
                        scout or escort Gamma Quad build, multistage plasma thrusters produce small
                        decreases in vertical boost, and manoeuvrability. For extra responsive
                        throttle and top speed, multistage thrusters are highly recommended.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Funnelled ion repeaters provide the ultimate speed increase for Gamma Quad
                        vehicles. In conjunction with any plasma thruster upgrade, and the Gamma
                        Quad's acceleration and top speed is dramatically improved. While Ion
                        Repeaters are renowned for additional speed, the upgrade adds weight,
                        reduces turning speed, and consumes more power, which results in a slightly
                        less fuel-efficient build.

                    <p>
                        Supercharging the primary weapons distributor produces a substantial
                        increase in projectile damage and projectile speed. This small upgrade is
                        ideal for dealing extra laser damage to targets with minimal drawbacks to
                        the Gamma Quad&#8217;s overall vehicle performance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Turbo charged weapons distributors harness substantial kinetic energy, and
                        the resulting laser discharge is spread over a much wider angle. This
                        increased laser output is ideal for military operations, but also comes at
                        a reduced fire rate, and an increase in vehicle weight.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Dual Rectifier Laser Distributor</h4>

                    <p>
                        The dual rectifier weapons system modification is a complete overhaul of
                        the primary firing chamber. With increased charge capacity, and a more
                        stable firing chamber, the Gamma Quad can unleash devastating volleys of
                        laser fire. This modification comes with significant extra weight, and a
                        greatly reduced fire rate.

                    </h3>
                    <h4>Reinforced Firing Chamber </h4>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reinforced firing chamber reduces vibrations and kinetic heat build-up
                        from the Gamma Quad&#8217;s primary weapon. This greatly helps improve the
                        firing chamber&#8217;s rate of fire while only slightly reducing the
                        weapon&#8217;s projectile damage. The reinforced chamber is a popular
                        choice for Gamma Quad vehicles supporting in assault operations.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Laser Recoil Dampener </h4>

                    <p>
                        Laser recoil dampeners improve the overall efficiency of the Gamma
                        Quad&#8217;s weapon capacitor and firing mechanism. With reduced heat and
                        recoil the primary weapon uses far less energy and provides a positive
                        reduction in the amount of fuel consumed when firing.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Ablative Laser Heat Sinks </h4>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With ablative heat sinks, the Gamma Quad&#8217;s primary weapon runs
                        substantially cooler. Safety protocols are offset and the primary
                        weapon&#8217;s rate of fire is greatly increased. The ablative heat sink
                        upgrade is one of the most popular choices among heavy combat pilots. The
                        heat sinks reduce overall projectile damage, and add extra weight resulting
                        in reduced speed, and slower turning rates.

                        Improvised shock mounts address a fundamental limitation in the Gamma
                        Quad's thruster housing design and greatly improves manoeuvrability. The
                        improvised shock mounts are the perfect addition to any Gamma Quad that
                        needs to be more agile out in the field.

                        difficult terrain as well out-maneuverer enemy combatants.

                    <p>
                        The lightweight strut modification offers a substantial refitting of the

                        assembly benefits greatly, and the turning speed is dramatically improved.
                        This modification does however come with the draw back of less speed, more

                        extra hull adds more weight to the Gamma Quad and reduces acceleration.

                        operations and comes at the expense of speed, turn rate and vertical boost
                        capacity.

                        The heavy gauss coil booster provides the best possible vertical stability
                        for the Gamma Quad chassis. Applied to the top funnel of the rear
                        thrusters, the gauss coil helps keep heavy of builds off the ground, no
                        matter the terrain.

                        Specialised lightweight materials are used to replace the majority of the
                        internal chassis frame of the Gamma Quad resulting in extra space for more
                        upgrade modifications.

                    <p>
                        Vacuum storage compartments greatly increase how many of each mineral and
                        component the Gamma Quad can store.

                        For long-range expeditions and long distance scouting operations, carbon
                        nanotube core internals greatly improve fuel distribution and efficiency.
                        The nanotube core modification is popular among exploration and recon
                        variations of the Gamma Quad.
